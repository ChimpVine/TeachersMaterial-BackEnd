{
  "mystery_game": {
    "topic": "A murder at an isolated mansion",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "no_of_clues": 4,
    "story": "In the isolated estate of Ravenswood Manor, a brutal murder occurred on a cold winter's night. Lord Harrington, the wealthy owner of the estate, was found dead in his study, locked from the inside. Only five guests were staying at the manor that evening: his estranged nephew, a retired general, a renowned artist, a family friend, and the loyal housekeeper. The storm outside raged all night, cutting off any chance of escape, yet Lord Harrington’s body lay lifeless, with no apparent sign of a struggle. The guests claim they were all in their rooms, but one of them is hiding the truth.",
    "question": "Who murdered Lord Harrington, and how did they commit the crime in a locked room?",
    "clues": [
      "Clue 1: The window in the study was slightly ajar, but the snow outside was undisturbed.",
      "Clue 2: Lord Harrington had recently changed his will, favoring one of the guests.",
      "Clue 3: A faint smell of turpentine was present in the study, though no paintings were found.",
      "Clue 4: The housekeeper was seen entering the study with tea, but never left through the door."
    ],
    "answer": "The murderer was the renowned artist. He used a hollowed-out paintbrush coated in poison, slipping it through the slightly open window to administer a fatal dose. The smell of turpentine came from his art supplies, which he used to prepare the weapon. The snow outside was undisturbed because the window was only open briefly, and he carried out the murder from the outside of the locked room."
