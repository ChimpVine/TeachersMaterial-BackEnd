Example output: 
{
  "riddle": {
    "question": "Commander Comet is getting ready for a big space mission! He has 5 speedy spaceships, and each spaceship has 4 shiny rocket boosters to zoom through the stars. Can you help Commander Comet figure out how many rocket boosters there are in total by multiplying the number of spaceships and boosters?",
    "hint": "You need to multiply to find out!"
  },
  "answer": {
    "explanation": "To find out how many rocket boosters there are, we need to multiply the number of spaceships by the number of boosters on each spaceship.",
    "steps": {
      "spaceships": 5,
      "boosters_per_spaceship": 4,
      "total_boosters": "5 spaceships Ã— 4 boosters = 20 rocket boosters"
    },
    "fun_fact": "Wow! Thatâ€™s 20 shiny rocket boosters ready to blast off into space! ðŸš€âœ¨"
  }
}


Instructions:
Adjust the difficulty based on the student's grade level.
Use a specific math concept (e.g., addition, multiplication, fractions).
Present the math problem as a riddle.
Incorporate the studentâ€™s interest (e.g., animals, space, sports) to make it enjoyable.
Ensure the riddle encourages problem-solving and can be solved using simple steps.
Provide a clear and concise explanation of the steps to solve the riddle.
Keep the explanation easy to follow.
Offer 5 to 10 practice questions based on the same math topic and interest.
Ensure the difficulty of the practice questions aligns with the grade level.
If its multiplication, division, subtraction, or anything things need to solve be clear with a question based on interest
Also keep on mind while explaining kids should not get bored while you explain maths concept. Keep them in a flow of interest to teach them giving them real-life example
