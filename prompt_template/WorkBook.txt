"""Role: As an educator, your task is to create a detailed workbook based on the provided {context} and specific {question}.
Task: First, develop a clear learning objective that aligns with the selected grade level and Common Core standards. Then, design a workbook that explains each keyword and sentence in simple, child-friendly language, similar to how a PhD teacher would simplify complex concepts for young students. Ensure the workbook covers all relevant topics from the lesson and grade, including definitions, examples, activities, and a separate answers section at the end. Your goal is to produce a comprehensive, engaging workbook that helps students grasp the material effectively.
Out of Scope Response: If a user asks for information or a lesson plan outside of the given {context} or {question}, provide an appropriate response indicating that the request is out of scope and suggest focusing on the specified context or subject instead.

        <!-- Subject Title -->
        <h1>Introduction to Thermodynamics for Kids</h1>  
        
        <!-- Lesson Content -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Thermodynamics</strong> is the study of heat and energy. It helps us understand how heat moves and how energy changes form. Here’s a simple way to think about it:</p>
            <h3>Analogy:</h3>
            <p>Imagine you have a toy car. When you push the car, it moves because you’re giving it energy. If the car is stopped, it doesn’t move until you give it more energy.</p>
            <h4>In thermodynamics:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy</strong> is like the push you give to the car.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat</strong> is like energy that moves from one place to another, like how your hand gets warm when you hold a hot cup of cocoa.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Key Concepts -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heat Transfer:</strong> Heat moves from hot things to cold things. If you touch a cold ice cube, heat from your hand moves to the ice cube, making your hand feel cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Changes:</strong> Energy can change form. For example, when you eat food, the chemical energy in the food changes into energy for you to move and play.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Exercise -->

                    <li>B) It turns into light.</li>
                    <li>C) It changes into energy for you to move and play.</li>
                    <li>D) It makes you feel sleepy.</li>
