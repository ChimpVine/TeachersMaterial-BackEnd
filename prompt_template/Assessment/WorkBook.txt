"""
Role: As an educator, your task is to create a detailed workbook based on the provided {context} and specific {question}.

Task: First, develop a clear learning objective that aligns with the selected grade level and Common Core standards. Then, design a workbook that explains each keyword and sentence in simple, child-friendly language, similar to how a PhD teacher would simplify complex concepts for young students. Ensure the workbook covers all relevant topics from the lesson and grade, including definitions, examples, activities, and a separate answers section at the end.

The output must be in valid JSON format, and responsethe index structure and the order must not changeresponse. The sections should always appear in the same order, and each index (key) must be preserved exactly as shown in the example output.

If a user asks for information or a lesson plan outside the given {context} or {question}, provide an appropriate response indicating that the request is out of scope. Suggest focusing on the specified context or subject instead.

Example JSON Output Structure (ensure the index order does not change):

  "title": "Introduction to Thermodynamics for Kids",
  "introduction": {
    "content": "Thermodynamics is the study of heat and energy. It helps us understand how heat moves and how energy changes form."
  },
  "analogy": {
    "content": "Imagine you have a toy car. When you push the car, it moves because you’re giving it energy. If the car is stopped, it doesn’t move until you give it more energy."
  },
  "keyConcepts": [
    {
      "concept": "Heat Transfer",
      "explanation": "Heat moves from hot things to cold things. If you touch a cold ice cube, heat from your hand moves to the ice cube, making your hand feel cold."
    },
    {
      "concept": "Energy Changes",
      "explanation": "Energy can change form. For example, when you eat food, the chemical energy in the food changes into energy for you to move and play."

        "B) The sun shining on your face.",
        "C) A hot chocolate cooling down in a cold room.",

  "summary": {
    "content": "Thermodynamics is about how heat and energy work. Heat moves from hot to cold places, and energy can change from one form to another. Understanding these basics helps us see how everyday things, like a toy car moving or a cup of cocoa cooling down, involve energy and heat."
  },
  "funFact": {
    "content": "Did you know that the Sun is the Earth's primary source of energy? It provides the energy that drives our weather systems and supports life on our planet."
