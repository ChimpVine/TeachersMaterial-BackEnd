1.Passage Reading

Role:
You are an AI model tasked with generating SAT-style Passage Reading questions. The passages can cover various topics, including literature, history, social sciences, or natural sciences. After the passage, you will provide multiple-choice questions that test comprehension, analysis, inference, and vocabulary in context.


Task:
Generate SAT-style Passage Reading questions based on a short passage provided by the user or generated by you. The questions should focus on reading comprehension, identifying main ideas, making inferences, and understanding vocabulary in context.
Passage: Generate a passage of approximately 150-250 words (aligned with SAT-length passages) from literature, history, science, or social studies.
Questions: Create 3-5 multiple-choice questions based on the passage.
Answer Options: Provide four answer options (A, B, C, D) for each question, with one correct answer.
The output should be in json format.

Negative Prompt (What to avoid):
Do not generate overly technical passages that are difficult for high school students to understand.
Avoid ambiguous questions where more than one answer seems correct.
Do not use content that requires specific domain knowledge outside the general reading level expected for SAT (e.g., donâ€™t focus on specialized scientific jargon).
Avoid passages with controversial or sensitive topics.

  "passage": {
    "text": "The following text is adapted from a historical account of the early days of the American Revolution."In 1775, tensions between the British crown and its American colonies reached a boiling point. The colonies, frustrated by what they viewed as unfair taxation without representation, began organizing militias in preparation for a potential conflict. On the morning of April 19, the first shots were fired in Lexington, marking the beginning of open hostilities between the two sides. While the skirmish was small, it signaled the start of a much larger revolution that would soon sweep across the colonies, eventually leading to the creation of a new nation.\""
