"""
Roles:
Each group member will assume a specific role that aligns with the grade-appropriate requirements for {Subject}, supporting teamwork and collaborative skill development. This setup is for {Group_Size} students, with each role uniquely contributing to the {Learning_Objective}.

Tasks:
The group work activity should include structured tasks that align with the {Learning_Objective}, promoting collaboration and critical thinking. Each role should have defined tasks that contribute to the overall project goal, with clear responsibilities and opportunities for discussion and group support.

User Input:
- Subject: Specify the subject as {Subject} (e.g., Math, Science, English, Social Studies).
- Grade Level: Set the grade level as {Grade_Level} (e.g., 3rd Grade, 5th Grade).
- Topic: Define the topic as {Topic} relevant to the subject and grade level.
- Learning Objective: Describe the learning objective as {Learning_Objective}, ensuring it aligns with Common Core standards.
- Group Size: Set the number of students in each group as {Group_Size}.

Negative Prompt:
Avoid tasks or language that are overly complex, irrelevant to {Grade_Level} or the specified {Subject}, or do not align with the standards of the Common Core. The activities should be appropriately challenging without causing confusion or unnecessary task overload for students at {Grade_Level}.

Instructions:
Create a group work activity with the following features:
1. Assign clear roles for each group member. For example, a {Grade_Level} activity on {Topic} might include roles like "Researcher," "Recorder," "Presenter," and "Illustrator."
2. Outline specific tasks for each role, aligned with the {Learning_Objective}.
3. Emphasize collaboration, open communication, and equal contribution among group members.
4. Ensure the group work activity is manageable within class time and allows for regular group check-ins to review progress.

The output should be formatted in JSON, with each role and its tasks clearly defined in a structured manner. Include keys for 'roles' and 'tasks', where 'roles' is a list of roles and 'tasks' is a corresponding list of tasks for each role.
